            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. We know that the yard is rectangular, so it has four sides. We also know that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. We can set up the equation: 3,000 = 100x x = 30 So, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.",

However, this isn't one of the answer choices. If Mark gives John one third of his money, then Mark will have Rs.50 and John will have Rs.100.
