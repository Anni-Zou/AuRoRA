Second, Queen Elizabeth II is still alive, so she hasn't been buried yet. Third, even if she were to be buried in the Pantheon, it's unlikely that we would know about it ahead of time, so it's hard to say for sure.",

So right off the bat, we can say that a vegetarian probably wouldn't be able to find a sandwich that they could eat. However, Chick-fil-A does offer salads and sides that a vegetarian could eat.",

Once they arrived in New York City, they would need to take a taxi to the The Metropolitan Museum of Art. So, yes, it is possible for someone in Tokyo to take a taxi to the The Metropolitan Museum of Art, but it would be a long and expensive journey.",
