If he had made _____ cakes initially, how many more cakes did baker make than those he sold?\" Now let's think about what we know. We know that the baker sold 8 cakes and that he made 40 cakes initially. From this, we can calculate that the baker made 32 more cakes than those he sold.",

That means there were 68 children on the bus before the 63 got off. 14 children remained on the bus, which means 54 children got on the bus.
